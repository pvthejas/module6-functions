# Exercise 2: writing and executing functions (II)

# Define a function `CompareLength` that takes in 2 character strings, and returns
# the sentence of the form
#   "The difference in length is N"
CompareLength <-function(str1, str2) {
  diff <- abs(nchar(str1) - nchar(str2))
  diff.string <- paste("The difference in length is", diff)
  
  retun (diff.string)
}

# Pass two strings of different lengths to your `CompareLength` function
CompareLength("Hi", "Hello")

# Define a function `DescribeDifference` that will return one of the following statements:
# "Your first string is longer by N characters"
# "Your second string is longer by N characters"


# Pass two strings of different lengths to your `DescribeDifference` function
